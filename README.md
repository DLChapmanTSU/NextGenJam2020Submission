# NextGenJam2020Submission
The game I created for the NextGenJam2020. This game was created by me in Unity 2019.4.0f1 and won the award for best game. I found the font used here: https://www.dafont.com/pixeled.font all other assets are my work.

The repository contains the main level created for the game jam plus the main menu.
It also contains an additional endless mode I created for the game.
Since this mode was not part of the version submitted for the jam, it has not been linked to the main game and thus can only be accessed by loading the project files.
